## Some Context on the Debt Situations

In 2020 Zambia's debt was estimated at 128.7% of GDP ([source](https://countryeconomy.com/national-debt/zambia)). The debt had increased from 25% of GDP in 2012 to 94% of GDP in 2019 ([IMF Global Debt Database](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets/GDD)). This poses a huge risk to the country's growth potential, this analysis seeks to find out if the change in governance has an effect on the sentiment towards the country's debt.
